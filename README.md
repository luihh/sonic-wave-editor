# Sonic Wave Editor

This is a simple code editor written in Rust and Typescript, using Tauri and React.  
Named after the Geometry Dash level "Sonic Wave" just because I think it sounds funny.

My goal is to be able to further develop the editor with the editor itself.

Forked from [hudy9x/huditor](https://github.com/hudy9x/huditor/) because I'm too lazy to start the project from 0 by myself.  
File and folder icons from [miguelsolorio/vscode-symbols](https://github.com/miguelsolorio/vscode-symbols)
