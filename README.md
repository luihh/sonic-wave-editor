# Sonic Wave Editor

This is a simple code editor written in Rust and Typescript, using Tauri and React.   
Named after the Geometry Dash level "Sonic Wave" just because I think it sounds funny.

Forked from [hudy9x/huditor](https://github.com/hudy9x/huditor/) because I'm too lazy to start the project from 0 by myself.
